For example "Ivanka" will open a new door for the player when
given a certain item and "Journalists" will end the game if given
The-nuclear-football. There will be two templates even if they
essentially do the same thing to make sure they're separated from
unexpected errors. The item will be removed if the override goes
through to avoid losing the item even if the NPC never receives it.|#
