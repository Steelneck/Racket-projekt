#|Special characters will have the ability to receive something.
For example "Ivanka" will open a new door for the player when
given a certain item and "Journalists" will end the game if given
The-nuclear-football. There will be two templates even if they
essentially do the same thing to make sure they're separated from
unexpected errors. Trigger for special-character1 will connect
two rooms, the procedure is bound with Ivanka.|#
